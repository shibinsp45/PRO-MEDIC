# PRO-MEDIC: Android Application Based Smart Medicine Vending Machine for Organisations

Pro-Medic is a project aimed at constructing a smart medicine vending machine  system that is designed to be time-saving and user-friendly. The system allows for cashless payments through digital payment methods by utilizing an Android application on smartphones. The project utilizes ESP32 hardware and leverages the Google Firebase software for data management and communication.



## Features

1. **Time-saving:** The Pro-Medic system automates the process of medicine dispensing, eliminating the need for manual intervention. Users can quickly and easily access the required medication without waiting in long queues.

2. **User-friendly interface:** The Android application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for browsing and selecting the desired medications. The interface is designed to be easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless user experience.

3. **Cashless payments:** Pro-Medic enables cashless transactions by integrating various digital payment methods. Users can make payments using their smartphones, eliminating the need for carrying physical cash.

4. **ESP32 hardware:** The system utilizes ESP32, a versatile microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. ESP32 acts as the central processing unit for the vending system, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between the hardware components and the Android application.

5. **Google Firebase:** Pro-Medic employs Google Firebase as the backend software solution. Firebase offers robust data management and synchronization capabilities, enabling seamless communication between the Android application and the ESP32 hardware.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the Pro-Medic system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Pro-Medic repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have the necessary development tools and libraries installed, including the Arduino IDE for ESP32 development and the Android Studio for the Android application.

3. Connect the ESP32 hardware to your development machine using the appropriate USB cable.

4. Open the ESP32 firmware project in the Arduino IDE and compile the code. Upload the compiled firmware to the ESP32 device.

5. Open the Android application project in Android Studio and configure the necessary dependencies and settings.

6. Build and run the Android application on your smartphone, ensuring that it is connected to the same network as the ESP32 device.

7. You are now ready to use the Pro-Medic system! Explore the medication catalog, select the desired medicine, and make cashless payments through the Android application.
